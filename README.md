# 486 Pentium Overdrive Socket for KiCAD
I created the symbol and footprint files for a 486 Pentium Overdrive socket, for use in various projects.

## Info
Made in KiCAD v5.x -- you can import the symbol and footprint and assign the step files for the 3D model.

This socket is for the full 486 socket, based on the Pentium Overdrive pinout. For a normal 486, it sits in the middle with the outer rows of pins unoccupied. I figured this symbol and footprint may be useful if you're designing an interposer board or replica motherboard.

Open source / open hardware, feel free to do what you want with it.
